<h1>WELCOME TO MEARN STACK</h1>
<div class="center">
    <p>MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. 
        It is used by developers worldwide. 
        The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. 
        This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based.
         Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend,
         and database can be operated easily.
         There are many good reasons to use the MERN Stack. 
         For example, it allows the creation of a 3-tier architecture that includes frontend, 
         backend, and database using JavaScript and JSON.
         MongoDB, which is the base of the MERN stack, is designed to store JSON data natively.
          Everything in it, including CLI and query language, is built using JSON and JS. The NoSQL database management system works well with NodeJS and thus, allows manipulating, representing, and storing JSON data at every tier of the application. </p>
